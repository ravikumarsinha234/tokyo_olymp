Tokyo Olympics Data Engineering Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a data engineering pipeline using Microsoft Azure to process, transform, and analyze data related to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The pipeline ingests raw data, processes it for analysis, and stores it in a structured format for visualization and insights.

Objectives

1. Data Ingestion: Collect and import raw Tokyo Olympics datasets (e.g., athlete details, medal tallies, event schedules).


2. Data Transformation: Clean, enrich, and structure the data for downstream analytics.


3. Data Storage: Store processed data in a scalable and query-friendly format.


4. Data Analysis: Enable analytics and visualization using tools like Power BI or Azure Synapse Analytics.


5. Automation: Set up automated pipelines to handle periodic data updates.

Architecture

Azure Services Used

1. Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS): Store raw and processed data in a hierarchical file system.


2. Azure Data Factory (ADF): Orchestrate data ingestion, transformation, and movement.


3. Azure Databricks: Perform data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment using Spark.


4. Azure Synapse Analytics: Store and query structured data for analysis.


5. Power BI: Visualize insights from processed data.


6. Azure Key Vault: Securely manage secrets like database credentials.

Data Pipeline Flow

1. Data Ingestion:

Data is ingested into Azure Data Lake from multiple sources (CSV, APIs, or public datasets).

Azure Data Factory pipelines orchestrate this process.



2. Data Transformation:

Azure Databricks cleans and processes raw data (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing formats).

Data is transformed into meaningful tables, e.g., medal_tally, athlete_details, and event_results.



3. Data Storage:

Processed data is stored in Azure Synapse Analytics for querying and reporting.



4. Visualization:

Power BI dashboards connect to Synapse to provide insights into athlete performance, medal distribution, and more.

Dataset

The dataset includes the following components:

Athletes: Name, age, gender, nationality, height, weight, etc.

Medals: Event name, medal type (Gold, Silver, Bronze), and winners.

Events: Event names, sports, schedules, and venues.

Countries: Participating countries and medal tallies.
